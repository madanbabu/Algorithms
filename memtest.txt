Here's an algorithm in Haskell to test memory usage:

### Step-by-step thought process:

1. We'll create a function that allocates increasing amounts of memory and measures the peak memory usage.
2. We'll use the `deepseq` function to force evaluation and measure memory usage after each allocation.
3. We'll use the `System.Mem` module to get the current memory usage.
4. We'll gradually increase the allocation size until we reach a maximum or hit an error.

### Key points to consider:

- Memory usage can vary between runs due to system load and other processes.
- We need to be careful not to exhaust system resources.
- The algorithm should be able to handle different allocation sizes.

### Summary and best practices:

This implementation does the following:

1. Defines a `testMemory` function that allocates a list of increasing size and measures the memory usage before and after forcing evaluation.
2. Uses `listArray` to create a large array, which is a memory-intensive operation.
3. Uses `getForeignAllocations` from `System.Mem` to measure memory usage.
4. Calculates the difference in memory usage to determine how much memory was actually allocated.
5. Runs the test for increasingly larger allocation sizes up to 16 million elements.

Best practices followed:
- Using `deepseq` to force evaluation and measure peak memory usage.
- Gradually increasing allocation size to test different levels of memory consumption.
- Measuring memory usage before and after allocation to account for temporary allocations.

To use this script, save it to a file (e.g., `memory_test.hs`) and run it with:

ghc --make memory_test.hs
./memory_test

This script will gradually increase the allocation size and measure memory usage. Keep in mind that this is a basic test and may not accurately reflect real-world memory usage patterns. For more comprehensive memory testing, you might want to consider using profiling tools or more specialized memory testing libraries.
