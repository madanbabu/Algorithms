1. Vectorization:
The current code calculates the acceleration for each body in a loop for each other body. This can be inefficient for larger simulations. You can use vectorization with numpy to perform calculations on all bodies simultaneously:
2. Efficiency:
Consider using a more efficient numerical integrator like the Runge-Kutta method for better accuracy with larger time steps. Libraries like scipy.integrate offer these functionalities.
3. Visualization:
Instead of plotting each individual trajectory point, consider using a line plot with fewer points to improve visualization clarity, especially for longer simulations.
4. Customizability:
Add functionalities to allow customizing initial conditions like mass, position, and velocity for each body dynamically.
